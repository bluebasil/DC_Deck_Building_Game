All card names are the property of DC 
Concept and card text are the property of Cryptozoic


This is a personal project to digitalize the DC deck builing game by Cryptozoic.  It is not intended for commertial use.

So Far
------

* Graphical user interface, written 100% in Python with the 'arcade' library.  Eventually goal of converting to a multiplayer web experiace for i can play with a couple of my friends
* Base set cards, supervillains, and personas (large cards) are fully programmed and functional
* Heros Unite personas are in
* Forever Evil cards and personas are in and currently testing (I decided to skip Heros Unite for now)

To Do
-----

* Finish Forever Evil by adding superheros (still denoted as SV's in the code)
* Corectly impliemnt care effect combo queing (abilities triggered by a played card should only trigger once the cards text has been fully followed)
* Add Heros Unite
* Add a small set or two.  each one will come with new features
* Get python<->Javascript socketing working, i have already played around with it a little to no sucess
* Create Javascript front end (I don't intend on prettying up the python interface because my eventual goal is a Javascript front end anyways)
