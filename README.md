All card names are the property of DC.  Concept and cards are the property of Cryptozoic.


This is a personal project to digitalize the DC deck builing game by Cryptozoic.  It is not intended for commertial use.

So Far
------

* Graphical user interface, written 100% in Python with the 'arcade' library.  Eventually goal of converting to a multiplayer web experiace for i can play with a couple of my friends
* Base set cards, supervillains, and personas (large cards) are fully programmed and functional
* Heros Unite personas are in
* Forever Evil is in
* Crossover 1: Justice Society of America is in testing
* Started to get Java <-> Python socket working for creating a java application (although javascript would be preffered)

To Do
-----

* Corectly impliemnt core effect combo queing (abilities triggered by a played card should only trigger once the cards text has been fully followed)
* Add Heros Unite
* Continue to add smaller sets. Each one will come with new features
* Get python<->Javascript socketing working, I have already played around with it a little to no sucess
* Create Javascript front end (I don't intend on prettying up the python interface because my eventual goal is a Javascript front end anyways)
* Create Android front end (if i continue to have trough getting a Javascript frontend to work)
* Save/Undo functionality (they may be the same mechanic)
